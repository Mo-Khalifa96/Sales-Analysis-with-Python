# Sales Analysis with Python

## About The Project
**This project utilizes the powers of Python to perform different Data Analysis tasks, in this case, sales analysis. It covers a wide variety of
data analysis methods for inspecting, filtering and analyzing data, encompassing the core aspects of data analysis, from simple data filtering 
techniques to data visualization.**
<br>
<br>

I have included here 12 csv files, which constitute the database that will be analyzed, as well as two versions for the project. The first version is 
a Python script with the raw code, which therefore can only be executed using Python and having all the necessary libraries installed on your device. 
The second version is a Jupyter Notebook with all the code from the original script but broken down into cells and slightly modified to suit Jupyter's 
user-friendly environment better, which makes the code easier to read and interact with. I recommend checking the Jupyter Notebook version.

## About The Data
**The data being analyzed here are taken from Kaggle.com, a popular website for finding and publishing datasets. You can easily access it by clicking [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/knightbearr/sales-product-data).
The dataset consists of real-world sales data representing a one-year worth of product sales of an electronics store, broken down and organized into 12 csv files, each file representing the sales record of a particular month.**
<br>


**The dataset is comprised of hundreds of thousands of electronics store purchases broken down by product type, prices, order date,
purchase address, etc., corresponding to the following coloumns:** <br>
 * **'Order ID'** - lists the unique IDs that are used to track orders. 
 * **'Product'** - lists the names of the products.
 * **'Quantity Ordered'** - lists the total quantity ordered of a particular item. 
 * **'Price Each'** - lists the prices of the products ordered. 
 * **'Order Date'** - lists the dates and time at which a customer made an order.
 * **'Purchase Address'** - lists the addresses the orders were delivered to.

**Here's a screenshot with a sample of the dataset:**

## Aim 
**The aim of this project is to demonstrate the data analysis skills I've learned thus far and to apply them to real-world scenarios. As such, this 
project asks and answers real-world questions about real-world sales data. For instance, "what was the best month for sales?", or, "which time of the day 
should we display advertisements to maximize the likelihood of customer's purchasing products?"**

## Quick Access
**You can quickly access the project from either of the links below. Both links will immediately direct you to the Jupyter notebook version with all the code and output rendered and ready for viewing. If you're unfamiliar with Jupyter, the notebook is basically organized into different sections which are comprised of different cells. Each cell includes a block of code as input and their corresponding results as output. Note however that the first link allows you to view the inputs and outputs but without interacting with the code. The second link on the other hand allows you to both view the notebook as well as interact with its code, which enables you to execute the code and reproduce the results yourself.**
